# Portfolio_1

## Portfolio Website
This repository contains the code for my first portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a beginner web developer and to highlight my work.

### Project Structure:
Index File (index.html)
The main page of the portfolio website, built entirely with HTML. This file contains the structure and layout of the homepage, including sections like Contact and Projects.

### Project Page (project.html)
This page focuses more on styling and design, using CSS to create visually appealing layouts and effects. It includes details about the projects I’ve worked on **(Projects are not included yet)**.

### Contact Page (contact.html)
A page with basic contact information and a form to get in touch. This page is a mix of HTML and CSS, with a simple design.

### Future Updates:
As I continue learning, I’ll add more features and pages, or even create new repositories to share my progress. This repository is meant to grow into a helpful guide for others who are new to web development.
