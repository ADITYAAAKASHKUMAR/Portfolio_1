# Portfolio_1

## Portfolio Website
This repository contains the code for my first portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a beginner web developer and provide a simple, clean design to highlight my work.

### Project Structure:
Index File (index.html)
The main page of the portfolio website, built entirely with HTML. This file contains the structure and layout of the homepage, including sections like About Me, Projects, and Skills.

### Project Page (project.html)
This page focuses more on styling and design, using CSS to create visually appealing layouts and effects. It includes details about the projects I’ve worked on.

### Contact Page (contact.html)
A page with basic contact information and a form to get in touch. This page is a mix of HTML and CSS, with a simple design to ensure it’s user-friendly.

### Future Updates:
As I continue learning, I’ll add more features and pages, or even create new repositories to share my progress. This repository is meant to grow into a helpful guide for others who are new to web development.
